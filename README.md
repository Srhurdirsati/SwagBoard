# ðŸ“‹ Bill of Materials (BOM) `FROM TUTORIAL`

- A NT3H2111W0FHKH NFC Chip: this will be the main component of our card -- it both handles the NFC functionality as well as harvests energy from the phone to light up the LED



- An ~2V LED. I'm using C2296, but feel free to pick a different color (note: this part may also be called 17-21SUYC/TR8)


- A 47Î© resistor


- A 220nF capacitor
